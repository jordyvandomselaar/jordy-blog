Welcome to my blog! This is my attempt at writing blog posts and dump thoughts worth sharing.

Oh, and; Hello world!

In case you're wondering what this blog's built with, I'm using the following awesome tools;

- [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) A static site generator for React
- [gatsby-starter-minimal-blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) A starter package for GatsbyJS targeted towards blogs. I'm a developer, not a designer. Sue me.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) Write markdown, render React components. It's also possible to add React components inside markdown!

It also brings a live code editor how cool is that?!

```js react-live
render(<h1>Hello, dear stranger</h1>)
```
