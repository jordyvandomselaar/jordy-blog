# [WIP] Using TypeScript with React

In this post I'll be showing you how to build your first TypeScript to-do app. If you've used React with TypeScript before this tutorial probably isn't for you. To keep things simple I'll mainly be focussing on React itself.

Inside `src/` you'll see folders with names that correspond to headers in this tutorial. Check inside for example code!

## Getting started

For this tutorial we'll be using [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app). To get started run the following commands in your terminal; `npx create-react-app todoApp â€”typescript`, this will scaffold a new TypeScript React app. _This could take a while._

When it's done you'll have the following file structure;

- README.md
- node_modules
- package-lock.json
- package.json
- public
	- favicon.ico
	- index.html
	- manifest.json
- src
	- App.css
	- App.test.tsx
	- App.tsx
	- index.css
	- index.tsx
	- logo.svg
	- react-app-env.d.ts
	- serviceWorker.ts
- tsconfig.json


To start a development server that automatically reloads your browser when changing code, run the following commands in your terminal;

```sh
cd todoApp
npm start
```

Your default browser should open automatically. If it doesn't, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` manually.

You'll see the following screen:

<CodeSandbox title="Getting started" url="https://codesandbox.io/embed/5klroqv26l" />

Save for the SVG that's not rendering, but that's not important.

## Cleaning up

Before we get started building something, let's clean up some files we won't be needing for this project.

Delete the following files;

- App.css
- App.test.tsx
- App.tsx
- index.css
- logo.svg

You'll notice you get a `ModuleNotFoundError` error. We'll fix that in the next step.

## Creating your first component

Let's create your first component!

Inside the project create the following file; `src/components/App.tsx` with the following code;

```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  return <h1>Welcome to my to-do app</h1>;
};

export default App;
```

Remember the error I told you about? To fix that, replace the code inside `index.tsx` with

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();

```

Your browser should automatically refresh to show the following;

<CodeSandbox title="Creating your first component" url="https://codesandbox.io/embed/l4w63r72om" />

## Defining the domain

Looking at our design we'll need the following components;

1. A to-do list, you know, to render to-do's
2. A to-do component, this will represent one to-do
3. A form to create a new to-do
    1. A submit button
    2. An input to write what we have to do

With that out of the way let's think about our domain for this app; What entities do we have? For our to-do app all we really need is a `Todo` entity. Let's create an `interface` for it.

**Creating your first interface**

Create the following file; `src/interfaces/Todo.ts`, notice the file extension is `.ts` instead of `.tsx`, since it won't contain any `JSX` (it will be plain TypeScript) you don't have to use `.tsx`.

Our to-do will have the following fields;

1. name
2. finished

`name` will be what we render inside the list, we'll use `finished` to determine if we've finished the to-do or not. 

An example to-do would look like this; 

```json
{
  "name": "My example to-do",
  "finished": false
}
```

As you can see `name` is a `string` and `finished` is a `boolean`.

Using this information we end up with the following interface;

```typescript
interface Todo {
    name: string;
    finished: boolean;
}
```

Put the following code inside `src/interfaces/Todo.ts`;

```typescript
export interface Todo {
  name: string;
  finished: boolean;
}
```

## Creating static components

Let's start building static components, they'll show what the app is going to look like but they won't be interactive yet.

Create the following file; `src/components/TodoList.tsx` with the following contents;

```typescript jsx
import React from "react";
import TodoListItem from "./TodoListItem"

const TodoList = ({todos}) => {
  return <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => <TodoListItem todo={todo}>/>)}
  </ul>;
};

export default TodoList;
```

It won't work yet since we don't have the other components yet. Let's build them as well;

`src/components/TodoListItem.tsx`

```typescript jsx
import React from "react";

const TodoListItem = ({todo}) => {
    return (
        <li><input type="checkbox" checked={todo.finished} />{todo.name}</li>
    );
};

export default TodoListItem;
```

- `src/components/NewTodoForm.tsx`
- `src/components/Button.tsx`
- `src/components/Input.tsx`
