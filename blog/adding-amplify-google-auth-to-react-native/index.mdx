## Intro

In this post, we'll create a React Native project, using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) to allow our users to log in with their Google accounts.

Amplify helps you add things like authentication, APIs, databases, hosting, and much more to your project by doing the heavy lifting for you.

This tutorial will explain how to use Amplify's Auth module with a Typescript React Native app. It'll cover both React Native CLI and Expo.

I'm writing this blog post because when I tried to implement Amplify Auth in my React Native app, I ran into some problems. Through this tutorial, I hope I can make it easier for both you and future me to get started!

For this tutorial, we'll be using [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started). I'll tell you when there's something specific to Expo or to React Native CLI.

## Getting started

First, we'll scaffold a new React Native app. To do so, we'll use the official tutorial for React Native CLI Quickstart. I'm using a Mac and Android phone, but you can select whichever platforms apply to you.

1. Scaffold a new project with Expo or the React Native CLI: [https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started), either Expo or React Native CLI is fine. Expo is easier to get started with whilst React Native CLI offers more freedom (and support for native modules).
    - When running `expo init`, you can pick a TypeScript template. If you're using React Native CLI, you'll want to use the following command: `npx react-native init MyTSProject --template react-native-template-typescript` 
2. You should now have a folder with the same name as you entered while scaffolding your app.
